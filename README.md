## !!!!!!!!! MUST READ !!!!!!!

- to avoid permissions issues **DO NOT place your projects folder on desktop**;
- there should be **NO SPACES in the path**. e.g. `C:\Users\Your Name\projects`;
- it is better to put repositories into `D:\projects` or `C:\Users\YourName\projects` on Windows, or `/Users/YourName/progects on MacOS.

## Before the first task
- Open your profile page on [the MA Platform](https://mate.academy/profile)
- Scroll down and press `Connect` button next to Github
- Confirm Mate academy app authorization

## Follow this steps:

### 1. Open the task on the MA platform
- click `Make a fork` button
- it will open the task repo page on Github

### 2. **Fork** the repo
![How to fork the repo](./images/fork-the-repo.png)

### 3. You should see your name in the URL instead of "mate-academy"
![After the repo fork](./images/after-the-repo-fork.png)

#### To check if the MA Platform sees the forked repo
- Go back to the task on the MA platform
- Reload the page
- The button should change to `Open the task`
- Get back to the forked repo on Github

#### If you need to delete a forked repo

### 4. **Clone** the forked repo be running `git clone the-link-from-github` (!!! Replace `the-link-from-github` with link from your repo)
<details>
  <summary>Show the details</summary>

 - Run `npm i` again ![npm install success](./images/npm-install-success.png)
</details>

### 8. Run `npm start` to check if it works. (Terminal command will never finish, so you need one mote terminal)
<details>
 <summary>Show the details</summary>

 - At this point you should see the starting markup of the page at `http://localhost:8080/` opened in your Google Chrome
 - Add some text to `src/index.html`. The change should be immediately updated in the browser.
 - If the page is not updated automatically press `ctrl + r` (`cmd + r` for macOS)
</details>

<details>
 <summary>If the page is empty after you added some text</summary>

 - Update the page by pressing `ctrl + r` (`cmd + r` for macOS)
 - If the page is still empty check if you saved the changes ![Autosave is disabled](./images/autosave-is-disabled.png)
 - Enable autosave ![Enable autosave](./images/enable-autosave.png)
</details>

<details>
 <summary>If the page is opened at the other port (not :8080)</summary>

 - If you see the other port ![Wrong port](./images/wrong-server-port.png)
 - It means you already have another terminal running `npm start` command (maybe it is another project)
 - Stop the `npm start` command in current terminal by pressing `ctrl + c` (all operating systems)
 - Close the other terminal running `npm start`
 - Run the command again for your current project
 - The URL should be now `http://localhost:8080/`
 - If the URL is still wrong, just restart the computer
</details>

### 9. Open one more terminal for the next steps.
<details>

 ![Open one more terminal](./images/open-one-more-terminal.png)
</details>

### 10. Create the `develop` branch (run `git checkout -b develop`)
<details>
  <summary>If you see that develop already exists</summary>

  ![Develop already exists](./images/develop-already-exists.png)
  - run `git branch` to see all existent branches ![Show git branches](./images/show-git-branch.png)
  - If `develop` is marked with `*` then everything is correct
  - Otherwise, run `git checkout develop` (without `-b` key) ![Switch to develop](./images/switch-to-develop.png)
</details>

### 11. Open `readme.md` file and replace a text `<your_account>` with your Github username in the `DEMO LINK` and `TEST REPORT LINK`
<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ![Update demo link](./images/update-demo-link.png)
</details>

### 12. Implement the task described in the `readme.md`. 
- You should write the code in `index.html` and other files inside `src` folder.

### 13. Run `npm run lint` to check the code style.
<details>
  <summary>If you have some errors</summary>

  - Fix all the errors and run the command again

  ![HTML autoformat json](./images/html-autoformat-json.png)
</details>

### 14. To check if your solution matches all the expectations you can run `npm test`
- If test results are not opened in a browser, check if you fixed all the code style errors (`npm run lint`)
- If you can't run tests for some weird reason just use a screenshot from
  `backstop_data/bitmaps_reference/Entire_document.png` to ensure your page looks as expected.

<details>
  <summary>If you see a failing test</summary>

### 15. Add your changed or created files to commit history `git add path/to/changed_file path/to/new_file`
- You can add all files in a certain folder using `.` character: `git add src/.`
- Don't add irrelevant files at this point, like `package-lock.json` or test snapshots.
- You can always check which files were changes or added using `git status` command.

### 16. Create a commit with all added files using `git commit -m 'commit message'`
- Commit message should describe the changes made in the files, e.g. `'added header'`
